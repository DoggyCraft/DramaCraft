The plugin for adding Drama to the DoggyCraft minecraft server!

Background
---------
The idea is to provide alot of social meta game mechanica that encourages simple roleplay, tension and drama to the gameplay.
The concept is that this will provide a lore/culture to the server that everyone can participate in.

*  The Empire is ruled by 1 King and 1 Queen
*  The King must be a boy
*  The Queen must be a girl
*  The King and Queen livs (has spawn) in the Royal Castle
*  Rebels are in opposition to the Empire
*  Rebels can start "revolutions"
